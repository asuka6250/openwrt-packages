/* @mirror — turn duplication you cannot delete into duplication that cannot ROT.
 *
 * Some duplication is forced, not chosen: CSS cannot share a declaration block across two
 * mutually-exclusive guards (the stacked table's card layout is needed under a CLASS —
 * .fs-stacked, the measured data table — AND under a CONTAINER QUERY: the config table, which
 * cannot be measured, see fs-select.js); and `install.sh` is fetched with `curl | sh` and runs
 * BEFORE the package exists, so it cannot source a library shipping inside the package — yet it
 * must do exactly what `footstrap-selfupdate.sh` does (fetch over a verified channel, pin the
 * asset host, check the sha256).
 *
 * THE TRAP, and the reason for this tool: a structural duplicate detector (tools/css-dup.mjs)
 * matches bodies that are IDENTICAL, so the moment two copies diverge it goes QUIET — exactly
 * when it should shout. Not hypothetical: `fetch()` in install.sh and footstrap-selfupdate.sh
 * had ALREADY drifted three ways (different backend order, one with no timeout on its
 * first-choice tool, one missing the https redirect pin) and nothing said a word. So: tag every
 * copy, assert they stay byte-identical.
 *
 *   shell / JS:   # @mirror <group>/<role>      …lines…      # @endmirror
 *   CSS:          /* @mirror <group>/<role> *\/  …rule…      /* @endmirror *\/
 *
 * Comparison ignores common leading indent and trailing whitespace (a copy may nest deeper);
 * everything else must match. A group with only ONE copy is an error too: a mirror of one is a
 * tag someone forgot to delete when the other copy died, and it enforces nothing.
